<h2>About:</h2>
Project denoting my participation in a limited time online event project called "NLW (Next Level Week)", created and ran by <a href="https://www.rocketseat.com.br/">"Rocketseat"</a>, in which I created a responsive user feedback widget for a website. It provided the user with a tool ready to receive their feedback, be it a suggestion, a bug report or an otherwise specific inquiry. The widget also came with the extra feature of being able to take a screenshot without any manual user input upload for revision. 

<h2>Development:</h2>
The project was made with:
